***Software Project Estimation***

**Calculated estimated effort:**
Calculating Estimated Efforts (the Estimated time it’ll take to complete the project)

Embedded – A software project requiring the highest level of complexity, creativity, and experience requirement fall under this category. Such software requires a larger team size than the other two models and also the developers need to be sufficiently experienced and creative to develop such complex models.

Basic Model: E = a(KLOC)^b
Embedded A: 3.6 B:1.20
10 Sub Task in the project. Those 10 might take between 1k and 3Kloc 

The last one might take at max 1kLOC

The net of all the Lines of Code would be on average 2k * 10 + 1K = 20 + 1 = 21KLOC 

The effort might be 3.6 * (21) ^ 1.20 = 138.9 person per month effort.

Duration = 2.5*(138.9)^0.32 = 12 months. So about a year on average. If done 1 by 1 of course, if instead it is done maybe 2 at a time we can reduce it to 6 months and furthermore depending on the people we have.

***Activity Planning***

***Risk Management***

1. Design Risk 
   Some of the design or content may fail to meet requirements or may be rejected by stakeholders. In that case, we need to reach a consensus with our customers before implementing the application.

2. Technology risk 
   Such as the connection outages that disrupt the service. To avoid this problem we have to make a backup plan which is about our contingency measures.

3. Lack of Experience
   Some employees may lack experience implementing an ios application, and in that case, we need to understand the employee’s strengths to allocate the work.

4. Security Risk
   The database design may introduce information security vulnerabilities. We should choose the best method to implement the database.
